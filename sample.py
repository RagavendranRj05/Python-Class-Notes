# What is Python?

# Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum,
#  and released in 1991.


# It is used for:

# 1. web development (server-side),
# 2. software development,
# 3. mathematics,
# 4. system scripting.


# Why Python?

# Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
# Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
# Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
# Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
# Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.


# KEY FEATURES IN PYTHON


# Feature	            Description
# Simple Syntax	    Easy to read and write
# Interpreted   	    Runs line by line, no need to compile
# Open Source	        Free to use
# Dynamically        Typed No need to declare data types
# Huge Libraries	    NumPy, Pandas, Django, Flask, TensorFlow
# Cross-platform	    Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS


# syntax

# Syntax refers to the rules that define the structure of code in a programming language.


##### Advantages of python

# 1. Simple and Easy to Learn

# Python uses plain English-like keywords, making it beginner-friendly and easy to read.

# 2. Readability and Clean Code

#  Code is more readable with proper indentation instead of using curly braces {}, resulting in clean and clear code.

# 3. Reduced Code Length

#  Python allows you to write fewer lines of code to accomplish tasks compared to other programming languages.


# 4.Cross-Platform Compatibility

# Python is platform-independent, meaning it runs on different operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) without modification.

# 5.Large Standard Library

# Python comes with a wide range of pre-built libraries (like NumPy, Pandas, Django) for various tasks like web development, data analysis, and machine learning.

# 6.Dynamically Typed Language

# Python automatically determines the type of variable based on the assigned value, so there's no need to declare it explicitly.

# 7.Extensive Support for Integration

# Python easily integrates with other languages (C, Java, .NET) and tools, allowing multi-language project development.

# 8. Open Source and Community Support

# Python is free to use and open-source, with a large developer community that contributes to its growth.


# COMMENTS

# Comments can be used to explain Python code.

# Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

# Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

##### .Single-line Comment

# 1. Starts with a # symbol

 
# 2. Anything after # is ignored by Python 


#####  .Multi-line Comment


# 1.Use triple quotes ''' ... ''' or """ ... """  docstring
